# PR #2304 UI/UX validation

Scope: Runtime settings screen, OAuth pair flows, conflict/error feedback. Reviewed current real application via Vite with intercepted API responses, not a replacement component harness.

Variants considered: category cards (selected: existing pattern, searchable, single column mobile and two columns desktop); dense setting table (less scrolling but poor phone form layout); provider wizard (clear pair grouping but unnecessary navigation and inconsistent with other runtime settings). Retained category cards and atomic provider pair saves.

| Category | Score | Evidence |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Visual hierarchy | 4 | Section headings, source/default hints, consistent cards; long descriptions wrap. |
| Interaction clarity | 4 | Write-only hint, risky confirmation, paired resets, retained drafts/reload on failures. |
| Mobile usability | 4 | Single-column375px layout;320px dialog remains in viewport; no document overflow. |
| Accessibility | 4 | Programmatic field labels/descriptions, native inputs, visible focus, text alerts, shared focus-trapping confirm dialog. |
| System consistency | 5 | Shared Alert/Button/Spinner/ConfirmDialog, design tokens and existing admin shell. |

Fixed: a validation error following a previous successful save left the stale success alert visible concurrently. requestSave now clears the prior success message; unit regression and browser all-provider loop verify feedback remains unambiguous.

Effect review: AdminSettings has one initial-load effect keyed to stable load callback. Draft/edit/save handlers do not trigger it. Explicit reload retains drafts; conflict prevents further writes until fresh revision is loaded. inFlight ref prevents repeated submissions. Confirmation uses existing shared focus handling.

Verification: pnpm exec playwright test tests/playwright/admin-settings-audit.spec.ts --project='iPhone SE (375x667)' --project='Desktop (1280x800)' --workers=1: 4/4 passed (53.9s).

Additional matching screenshots for both required viewports are in the same directory (15 PNGs total). No remaining UI blockers. Native single-line value inputs horizontally scroll their own long content; this does not widen or clip the form. Existing admin tabs intentionally horizontally scroll within their navigation container. API/runtime correctness and production verification belong to the parent owner. Screenshots still need posting to PR evidence by parent; no external write or commit was performed here.
